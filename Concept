This project writes code that (1) simulates some ecological phenomenon (e.g. population size or species richness)  with a defined number of drivers (i.e. causal mechanisms or independent variables) and (2) the sampling process by which data are collected.  Thus, we create a dependent variable (i.e. response variable or ecological phenomenon) that is a function of 1:D different drivers and we sample 1:V different variables (i.e. potential drivers).  The sampled variables may or may not include the true drivers.
We will start with the dependent variable being a simple linear function of the drivers without interactions among thedrivers. The complexity of the model will be defined by the number of causal variables.
As we increase the complexity of the models we will add nonlinearity and interactions.
The sampling design will manipulate sample size, measurement error on the dependent variable, measurement error on the independent variable and amount of correlation among independent variables.  In addition, we will sample between 0 and 100 % of the true drivers.  This incorporates the concept of 'model error'.
